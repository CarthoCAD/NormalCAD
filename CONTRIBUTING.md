### Examples

fix(io): prevent crash on empty DXF files (#17)
i18n(pt-BR): translate property palette strings (#58)
refactor(geometry): simplify intersection algorithm (#61)
```

## Branching

```bash
main         ← integration and releases
feat/*       ← new features
fix/*        ← bug fixes
```

## Workflow

1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Make changes with conventional commits referencing an issue
3. Open a PR to `main` (CI runs build, tests, and commit validation)
4. After review, merge into `main`
5. When ready for release, go to Actions → Release → Run workflow
